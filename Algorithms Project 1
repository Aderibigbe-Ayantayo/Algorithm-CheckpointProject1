Here is an algorithm that reads a sentence character by character, determines the length of the sentence, counts the number of words, and counts the number of vowels. The sentence ends with a period ('.').

Algorithm Steps
Initialize three counters: length, word_count, and vowel_count to 0.
Initialize a variable in_word to keep track of whether the current character is part of a word.
Read each character until a period ('.') is encountered.
For each character:
Increment the length counter.
If the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U), increment the vowel_count.
If the character is a space and in_word is true, increment the word_count and set in_word to false.
If the character is not a space and in_word is false, set in_word to true.
After the loop, if in_word is true, increment the word_count to account for the last word.
Print the values of length, word_count, and vowel_count.
